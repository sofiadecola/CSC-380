      <summary>About Me!</summary>
    <p> I am from Plymouth Massachusetts. I am involved on campus as the President of Gamma Phi Beta, the New Member Educator and former
      Co-President of Alpha Phi Omega, a singer in jazz band, a member of the Computer Science helpdesk, as well as participating in on-campus research 
      writing code to analyze proteomics data. I recently returned from studying abroad in Germany this past spring term, as pictured above! 
      My favorite color is green, I love to travel, play guitar, and spending time with my friends and dog. Her name is Mocha. </p>
